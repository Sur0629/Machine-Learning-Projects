Objective:
Develop a machine learning model to predict loan approval status based on applicant data, improving the efficiency and accuracy of the loan approval process.

Key Activities:

Data Collection:

Gathered a dataset containing loan applicant information, including demographic details, financial data, and loan specifics.
Ensured the dataset had comprehensive records of both approved and rejected loan applications.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Used Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy) to clean and preprocess the data.
Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and encoded categorical variables.
Standardized numerical features using techniques like normalization and scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted EDA to understand the data distribution and key relationships.
Visualized data using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify patterns and correlations.
Generated summary statistics to describe the central tendency and dispersion of the data.
Feature Engineering:

Created new features to enhance model performance, such as income-to-loan ratio and length of employment.
Selected relevant features based on correlation analysis and domain knowledge.
Model Building:

Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Built multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) using Scikit-Learn.
Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.
Used cross-validation to ensure model robustness and prevent overfitting.
Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Model Deployment:

Deployed the final model to predict loan approval status on new applicant data.
Created a user-friendly interface for business users to input applicant details and receive predictions.
Insights and Recommendations:

Provided insights into the key factors influencing loan approval decisions.
Recommended strategies to improve the loan approval process based on model findings.
Tools and Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and visualization
